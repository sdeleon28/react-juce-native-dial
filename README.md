# react-juce-native-dial

Dial writen in C++ for react-juce. This implementation avoids any kind of jitter that you may experience while turning a dial because it doesn't send values over the bridge as the user drags.

There's no properly packaged build for this, so you'll have to copy files into the appropriate places.
